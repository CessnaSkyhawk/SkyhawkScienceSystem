	  //Spaceplanes Branch
	  #LOC_SSS_spaceplanes4_title = Rocket Planes
      #LOC_SSS_spaceplanes4_description = When we realized that our planes weren't going fast enough for our liking, it was time yet another application for the age-old paradigm "Moar Boosters!!!"
      #LOC_SSS_spaceplanes5_title = Ramjets
      #LOC_SSS_spaceplanes5_description = Wherner originally named these things "flying stovepipes", but we decided that was too lengthy, and called them ramjets instead. 	
      #LOC_SSS_spaceplanes6_title = Advanced Ramjets
      #LOC_SSS_spaceplanes6_description = We tried figuring out ways to make ramjets better, but had no luck until an intern suggests "ramming more air into the same engine".
      #LOC_SSS_spaceplanes7_title = Scramjets
      #LOC_SSS_spaceplanes7_description = You'll be scraming... err, screaming, when you realize just how fast you're nosediving into the ground.
      #LOC_SSS_spaceplanes8_title = Orbital Manuvering Systems
      #LOC_SSS_spaceplanes8_description = After an rather unfortunate incident, we've discovered jet engines in fact do not work in space. We're gonna need to retrofit some more traditional engines if we want our planes to stay up there for a reasonable time.	  
      #LOC_SSS_spaceplanes9_title = Multi-Mode Engines
      #LOC_SSS_spaceplanes9_description =  Half jet, half rocket, these cool engines are 100% awesome!

      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics1_title = Post-War Aviation
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics1_description = We have all these old fighters and bombers - let's put them to good use! (No Jeb, performing bombing runs on the admin building is not good use - even if Mortimer is really annoying)
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics2_title = Experimental Jet Engines
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics2_description = Propellers are cool and all, but they are kinda slow, and also a little too good at chopping off fingers. Let's try something new!
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics3_title = Mature Jet Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics3_description = We've managed to get jet engines to point where they no longer explode after 10 seconds of flight time. That'll be a boon to our aeronautics program
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics4_title = Supersonic Flight Testing
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics4_description = Breaking the sound barrier will be a very dangerous challenge, and there's no guarantee the pilot will survive it. Naturally, the line for volunteers was out the door...
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics5_title = Mature Supersonic Flight
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics5_description = We've proven we can break the sound barrier, but now, we need to prove we can actually do useful things while traveling that fast. Let's see what happens...  	
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics6_title = Hypersonic Flight Development
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics6_description = Supersonic flight has become so easy we can do it in our sleep. Let's try something a bit more challenging.
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics7_title = Mature Hypersonic Flight
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics7_description = These awesome planes can go so fast they go straight out of our atmosphere, just like a rocket!

      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics8_description = The dream is alive! We've found a way to send a spacecraft to orbit, and then land it back on Kerbin like a plane!
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics9_title = SSTOs
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics9_description = The days of conventional rockets are coming to a close. Even the most powerful of boosters will soon sucumb to the sheer awesomeness of orbit-capable spaceplanes!   	
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics10_title = High-Performance SSTOs
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics10_description = The Skyhawk Aerospace Corporation certifies that these SSTO's performance is due to advanced engine design, NOT so-called "aerodynamic trickery"...
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics11_title = Aerodynamic Mastery
      #LOC_SSS_aerodynamics11_description = With these high-tech engines, you can now master even the most difficult of atmospheres. A lack of oxygen will hinder you no longer! 	 

      // Aviation Branch
      #LOC_SSS_aviation2_title = General Aviation
      #LOC_SSS_aviation2_description = "Skyhawk Seven Eight One Kilo Sierra, cleared for takeoff, runway zero-niner. Make left closed traffic, and watch out for the rocket launching just to the south of the field." 
      #LOC_SSS_aviation3_title = Propliners
      #LOC_SSS_aviation3_description = These planes are big, loud, slow, and inefficent. They're the perfect next step for our aerospace program!
      #LOC_SSS_aviation4_title = Buisness Jets
      #LOC_SSS_aviation4_description = Mortimer said we needed a more dignified way to get him to important funding meetings. This is what we came up with!
      #LOC_SSS_aviation5_title = Regional Jets
      #LOC_SSS_aviation5_description = These jets have cramped, uncomfortable cabins, but that's not a huge deal, as our crews will only be in them for an hour or two at a time. Or at least, that's what we told them...
      #LOC_SSS_aviation6_title = Wide-Body Airliners
      #LOC_SSS_aviation6_description = Air Kerbin offered to give us some scrapped parts at discount rates. 	
      #LOC_SSS_aviation7_title = Jumbo Jets
      #LOC_SSS_aviation7_description = For when you need to carry an entire rocket stage halfway across the continent.
	  
	  //Comms Branch 	
      #LOC_SSS_comms2_title = VHF Band Comms
      #LOC_SSS_comms2_description = Great for both short range comms, and for tuning in for the big Kankees game. 
      #LOC_SSS_comms3_title = Communication Satellites
      #LOC_SSS_comms3_description = We kept having issues losing satellites the moment they went over the horizon. Now, we should be able to talk to them from anywhere!
      #LOC_SSS_comms4_title = UHF Band Comms
      #LOC_SSS_comms4_description = We keep hearing things about how "dish" and "omni" antennas aren't the same, but at this point, there's no evidence of there being any differences in their effectiveness.
      #LOC_SSS_comms5_title = S Band Comms
      #LOC_SSS_comms5_description = The S stands for hope. Specifically, for the hope that we won't lose contact with this mission once it leaves Kerbin's SOI.
      #LOC_SSS_comms6_title = X Band Comms
      #LOC_SSS_comms6_description = We named this comms band after what we caught Wherner's intern Linus streaming on it.
      #LOC_SSS_comms7_title = Ka Band Comms
      #LOC_SSS_comms7_description = We had to split the K band into multiple parts due to certain portions of it getting into a funky resonance with atmospheric water vapor. Being the highest frequency one, we decided Ka was the best one to stick with. After all, as they always say, bigger is better!
      #LOC_SSS_comms8_title = High-Speed Comms
      #LOC_SSS_comms8_description = Bob kept complaining that he couldn't stream his favorite movie, Expedition Eve, while en route to Duna. We decided to find a way to boost the data rates before things got messy. 
      #LOC_SSS_comms9_title =  Optical Communication
      #LOC_SSS_comms9_description = While the name makes it sound futuristic, it's really just the high-tech application of flashlights and morse code.	
      #LOC_SSS_comms10_title = Laser-Line Relays
      #LOC_SSS_comms10_description = Make sure not to get these mixed up with the microwave power transmission beams, or you'll end up getting a very different kind of streaming, or should I say, steaming, then you expected.
      #LOC_SSS_comms11_title = Ansibles
      #LOC_SSS_comms11_description = Capable of communicating across any distance instantly, these quantumn devices are great for staying ahead of those darn Formics!	
	
	  // Control Branch
      #LOC_SSS_control1_title = Spin-Stabilization
      #LOC_SSS_control1_description = Our rockets wouldn't fly straight, so we tried spinning. It's a good trick!	
      #LOC_SSS_control2_title = Reaction Thrusters
      #LOC_SSS_control2_description = We recently discovered a new law of physics, namely that any action has an equal and opposite reaction. We can use this to control our rockets!
      #LOC_SSS_control3_title = Upper Stage Guidance //SAS
      #LOC_SSS_control3_description = By making our upper stages smarter, we can finally control them once we make orbit.
      #LOC_SSS_control4_title = Improved Thrusters
      #LOC_SSS_control4_description = These improved thrusters are more powerful, and use hydrazine much more efficiently. They also come in a variety of creative shapes, allowing for us to have an much more interesting assortment of thruster orientations.
      #LOC_SSS_control5_title = Deep Space Avionics //Orbital Directions 
      #LOC_SSS_control5_description = Our spacecraft kept shutting down after getting too far from Kerbin. Turns out interplanetary radiation is bad enough that we need special gear out there. 	
      #LOC_SSS_control6_title = Advanced Thrusters
      #LOC_SSS_control6_description = These heavy duty thrusters can keep even the most ornery of rockets under control, making them great for keeping questionably stable designs from tumbling during ascent.
      #LOC_SSS_control7_title = Intergrated Avionics Systems  //Manuver Nodes
      #LOC_SSS_control7_description = By directly integrating advanced avionics computers into our probe cores and control blocks, we can allow for spacecraft to perform much more complex manuvers on the fly, rather than having to rely on either manual control or precoded actions.
      #LOC_SSS_control8_title = Vernier Thrusters
      #LOC_SSS_control8_description = Carrying monoprop is always a hassle, so we realized that if we made really tiny liquid rocket engines, we could use those for control instead!.
      #LOC_SSS_control9_title = Modern Avionics //Advanced docking mod parallel/antiparallel stuff.
      #LOC_SSS_control9_description = Modern spacecraft need modern avionics 	
      #LOC_SSS_control10_title = Fully-Automated Launch Vehicles
      #LOC_SSS_control10_description = Look Ma, no hands!
      #LOC_SSS_control11_title = Exotic Control Systems
      #LOC_SSS_control11_description = For those times when everything has to be nuclear powered...

	  // Probes Branch
      #LOC_SSS_probes2_title = Primitive Satellites
      #LOC_SSS_probes2_description = What's the point in messing with fancy doodads. Just slap some solar panels and an antenna on it and call it a day! We've got Krussians to beat!
      #LOC_SSS_probes3_title = Basic Satellites
      #LOC_SSS_probes3_description = These slightly more fleshed-out satellites will likely have plenty of useful niches in the upcoming few years.
      #LOC_SSS_probes4_title = Munar Exploration
      #LOC_SSS_probes4_description = The Mun has hung above us for as long as we can remember. Let's finally get up close and personal and see what it's made of... Hopefully it's cheese!
      #LOC_SSS_probes5_title = Interplanetary Flybys
      #LOC_SSS_probes5_description = There's no better time to do science then when you are screaming by a planet at thousands of meters a second! 	
      #LOC_SSS_probes6_title = Interplanetary Orbiters
      #LOC_SSS_probes6_description = Now that the planets know us, hopefully they'll let us stick around them for a while.
      #LOC_SSS_probes7_title = Grand Tours
      #LOC_SSS_probes7_description = R&D has found that there's gonna be some pretty sweet gravity assist routes coming up soon. Let's send probes on them to flex on the-*ahem*-to get some good science!
      #LOC_SSS_probes8_title = Gas Giant Exploration
      #LOC_SSS_probes8_description = Gas Giants, with their huge moon systems, seem like a pretty cool place to explore. Just watch out for all the radiation!
      #LOC_SSS_probes9_title =  Deep Space Exploration
      #LOC_SSS_probes9_description = These probes just want to get as far away from us as fast as they can. Was it something we said? 	


	  // Landing Branch
      #LOC_SSS_landing2_title = Re-entry Testing
      #LOC_SSS_landing2_description = Getting out of the atmosphere is no small feat, but it seems like we might have just as much trouble getting back in.
      #LOC_SSS_landing3_title = Entry, Descent, and Landing
      #LOC_SSS_landing3_description = There's a lot of things that need to go right to get a spacecraft out of orbit. We're aiming for at least one of them to work out.
      #LOC_SSS_landing4_title = Spacecraft Recovery
      #LOC_SSS_landing4_description = They say any landing you can walk away from is a good one. We think it's even better if the wreckage is still recognizable!
      #LOC_SSS_landing5_title = Off-World Landing
      #LOC_SSS_landing5_description = Turns out landing gets quite a bit harder when there's no atmosphere to slow yourself down with, but we think we've finally found the answer...  	
      #LOC_SSS_landing6_title = Atmopsheric Landers
      #LOC_SSS_landing6_description = Our parachutes, which worked fine back at Kerbin, kept getting shredded by Eve's atmosphere, until one brave intern posited his groundbreaking theory - Eve isn't Kerbin.
      #LOC_SSS_landing7_title = Manned Landers
      #LOC_SSS_landing7_description = Who cares about survival! I want a kerbal walking on that rock tommorow!
      #LOC_SSS_landing8_title = Improved Manned Landers
      #LOC_SSS_landing8_description = One small step for a kerbal. One giant leap for kerbalkind. 
      #LOC_SSS_landing9_title = Advanced Manned Landers
      #LOC_SSS_landing9_description = If you're waiting this long for your first Mun landing , than I recommend you just go for it. Your landers aren't going to get much better then this. 	
      #LOC_SSS_landing10_title = Reusable Shuttles
      #LOC_SSS_landing10_description = Throwing away an entire lander every time you want to go down to the surface starts getting pretty pricey. 
      #LOC_SSS_landing11_title = Planetary Dropships
      #LOC_SSS_landing11_description = For when you need to get planetside in a hurry.	

	  //Reuse Branch
      #LOC_SSS_reuse9_title = Booster Recovery
      #LOC_SSS_reuse9_description = One visionary kerbal pointed out that it'd be a lot easier to launch rockets if we could use them multiple times. He was laughed out of the admin building, but got his revenge a week later when he landed a spent booster in the pool. 	
      #LOC_SSS_reuse10_title = Rapid Reusability
      #LOC_SSS_reuse10_description = We want to get to the point where we can be turning around rockets by the hour. Pretty soon the KSC is gonna look less like a spaceport, and more like an airport terminal! //Actually written at an airport terminal as well!

	  // Robotics Branch
      #LOC_SSS_robotics6_title = Basic Robotics
      #LOC_SSS_robotics6_description = Bee-boo-boo-bop, boo-boo-bee-bop? Not bee-boo-boo-beep? Bop? Beep? Boo-boo-bop? 
      #LOC_SSS_robotics7_title = Rover Design
      #LOC_SSS_robotics7_description = After a fairly embarrassing incident where our lander landed only a few feet away from its target, but had no way to get close enough for observations, we decided to make our future ones able to roll over after a botched landing.
      #LOC_SSS_robotics8_title = Improved Roving
      #LOC_SSS_robotics8_description = They see me rovin'. They hatin'. Patrolling and tryin' to catch me ridin' dirty.
      #LOC_SSS_robotics9_title =  High-Tech Robotics
      #LOC_SSS_robotics9_description = These advanced robots can do all sorts of crazy things that we'd never dreamed were possible. We promise they aren't actually controled by a Kerbal hidden behind that convenient curtain over there... 	
      #LOC_SSS_robotics10_title = Machine Learning
      #LOC_SSS_robotics10_description = After running hundreds of generations, we've managed to make it to the point where our rockets actually leave the ground, rather than just exploding on the pad.
      #LOC_SSS_robotics11_title = AI Guidance
      #LOC_SSS_robotics11_description = "I'm sorry Jeb, I'm afraid I can't do that..."	

	  // Solid-Fuel Branch
      #LOC_SSS_solids1_title = Solid-Fuel Sounding Rockets
      #LOC_SSS_solids1_description = These glorified fireworks are supposed to be able to carry stuff without exploding. But hey, if they do, it'll be pretty, so it's a win-win situation either way! 	
      #LOC_SSS_solids2_title =  Solid Rocket Motors
      #LOC_SSS_solids2_description = We stole these motors from a university rocket team. They're rated to get us to about 5,000 feet, but we think we can do better than that...
      #LOC_SSS_solids3_title = Early Solid Rocket Boosters
      #LOC_SSS_solids3_description = After our latest rocket couldn't make it off the pad due to a lack of thrust, one plucky engineer suggested strapping some SRBs to the side of it. And with that one suggestion, Kerbal-kind's most salient adage was born: "Moar Boosters!"
      #LOC_SSS_solids4_title = Improved Solid Rocket Boosters
      #LOC_SSS_solids4_description = There have been rumors that there some sort of so-called "Solid-Safe" technology which allows one to shut down SRBs currently in development. We at the Skyhawk Aerospace Corporation assure these rumors are false and that we definetly aren't working on that at this very minute.
      #LOC_SSS_solids5_title = Mature Solid Rocket Boosters
      #LOC_SSS_solids5_description = SRBs have established a solid niche for themselves - they might not be as efficent as other motors, but they're cheap, reliable, and make really big booms when they fail. What else could a Kerbal want?	
      #LOC_SSS_solids6_title = Medium-Lift Solid Rocket Boosters
      #LOC_SSS_solids6_description = By building SRBs in mass-produced segments, it makes it much easier to stack them up to be just the right size for your payload, rather than needing custom ones for every flight.
      #LOC_SSS_solids7_title = Heavy-Lift Solid Rocket Boosters
      #LOC_SSS_solids7_description = The best way to tell that you might have more boosters than you need (although you can never truly have TOO many) is when the launchpad explodes on rollout.
      #LOC_SSS_solids8_title = Super Heavy-Lift Solid Rocket Boosters
      #LOC_SSS_solids8_description = These heavy-duty solid rocket boosters are no-nonsene powerhouses. Just make sure to keep an eye of the O-rings.
      #LOC_SSS_solids9_title = Modern Solid Rocket Boosters
      #LOC_SSS_solids9_description = Modern rockets require modern boosters. 	
      #LOC_SSS_solids10_title = Near-Future Solid Rocket Boosters
      #LOC_SSS_solids10_description = You'd think that these top of the line solid rocket boosters would finally be able to shut themsevles off. For once, you'd actually be right. Sort of.

	  //Cryogenic Branch
      #LOC_SSS_cryo2_title = Early Cryogenic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_cryo2_description = These fuels are so cold! Are we really sure they'll be able to make rocket flames?
      #LOC_SSS_cryo3_title = Improved Cryogenic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_cryo3_description = We've been having some trouble keeping the LH2 around, but when we are able to, we've had some pretty darn good results!
      #LOC_SSS_cryo4_title = Mature Cryogenic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_cryo4_description = These engines work fairly well, but don't expect them to be as flexible as your kerolox or hypergolic ones.
      #LOC_SSS_cryo5_title = High-Performance Cryogenic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_cryo5_description = We think we've finally hit a huge breakthrough with cryogenic engines. These new models are so insanely efficent they blow everything else out of the water!
      #LOC_SSS_cryo6_title = Medium-Lift Cryogenic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_cryo6_description = We've discovered another cool fuel called Methane. It's not as efficent as LH2, but it tends to evaporate much less quickly. We have high hopes for it in the future! 	
      #LOC_SSS_cryo7_title = Heavy-Lift Cryogenic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_cryo7_description = Who needs bigger engines when you can just attach like ten of them to the rocket stage instead?
      #LOC_SSS_cryo8_title = Super Heavy-Lift Cryogenic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_cryo8_description = These engines are some of the best in their class. With crazy efficency and respectable thrust, we expect them to dominate the competition.
      #LOC_SSS_cryo9_title = Modern Cryogenic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_cryo9_description = If all goes well, these bad boys will finally see service in 2022!
      #LOC_SSS_cryo10_title = Near-Future Cryogenic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_cryo10_description = There's only one question to ask about these advanced engines, and it's "Wen hop?"
	  
	  // Kerolox Branch
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox1_title = Liquid-Fuel Sounding Rockets
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox1_description = One day, a slightly too drunk Wherner had the idea to fill up a giant steel tube with booze, pump in some LOX and set it ablaze. Soon after, by way of a huge explosion, the field of rocketry was born. 
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox2_title = Early Kerolox Engines
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox2_description = Kerolox seems to be the most "average" of the fuels. In the words of one strange purple Kerbal, it's "perfectly balanced as all things should be".
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox3_title = Improved Kerolox Engines
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox3_description = With a failure rate under 50%, these engines will pave the way to more sucessful missions. At least, if RNGesus allows them.
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox4_title = Mature Kerolox Engines
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox4_description = We've got enough du now that these engines shouldn't fail much anymore. What's du, you ask? I don't know either, but all the RP-1 players say it's pretty important.
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox5_title = High-Performance Kerolox Engines
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox5_description = While kerolox engines will never match the efficency of cryogenic engines or the storability of hypergolics, they've managed to hack out a solid niche for themselves as reliable, flexible, booster engines.
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox6_title = Medium-Lift Kerolox Engines
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox6_description = After one particularly chilly morning, Bill decided the VAB needed a better heating system. After realizing kerosene is used in a lot of smaller heaters, he set out to work. A few hours later, he had a prototype space heater made out of Mainsail. Things sure got hot when he then proceeded to burn down the entire VAB upon ignition.
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox7_title = Heavy-Lift Kerolox Engines
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox7_description = When you've got to lift an entire 3 ker-man capsule up the steep slope into orbit, you're gonna be glad to have these trusty engines on your side.
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox8_title = Super Heavy-Lift Kerolox Engines
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox8_description = In order to get us to the Mun, we've had to construct the biggest engines we've ever built. Entire industries have been shaken, and paragims shifted, due to the sheer awe most kerbals had when they saw the end results.
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox9_title = Modern Kerolox Engines
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox9_description = Modern rockets require modern engines.	
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox10_title = Near-Future Kerolox Engines
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox10_description = These futuristic kerosense engines come in all sorts of funky shapes. The engineers ensure us that the weirdness of their designs is the most important part of how they work.
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox11_title = Conventional Mastery
      #LOC_SSS_kerolox11_description = We've learned everything we could possibly learn about conventional rockets. These engines and tanks are the best of the best!

	  //Hypergolic Branch
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol2_title = Early Hypergolic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol2_description = All the other propellants like to disappear when we aren't looking. These two are much better behaved.
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol3_title = Improved Hypergolic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol3_description = While these fuels are great in how they stick around no matter what, we've also found they're certainly good for Bill to drink.
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol4_title = Mature Hypergolic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol4_description = Hypergolic fuels were already the best behaved of the bunch, but they're even better now that they're all grown up!
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol5_title = High-Performance Hypergolic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol5_description = These engines are actually almost as good down low in the atmosphere as they are on upper stages - just watch out! You won't want to get anywhere near the fumes. 	
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol6_title = Medium-Lift Hypergolic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol6_description = Hypergolic engines have proven themselves to be incredibly flexible, working with engines ranging from probe thrusters to first stage boosters. They can do almost anything, except for being safe to work with.
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol7_title = Heavy-Lift Hypergolic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol7_description = Someone asked us why we only use Aerozine50, NTO, and Hydrazine, when there's so many other hypergolic options avalible. We said that it was just simplier that way, and also that we don't trust the ground crews with one set of fuels, so having more would pretty much be asking for trouble.
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol8_title = Super Heavy-Lift Hypergolic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol8_description = Be careful! If one of these bad boys blows up, the launchpad might not be particularly safe for the next couple decades or so.
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol9_title =  Modern Hypergolic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol9_description = These engines are quite a bit safer now, but that still doesn't mean you can just drop them anywhere you want. 	
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol10_title = Near-Future Hypergolic Engines
      #LOC_SSS_hypergol10_description = These advanced engines are better in nearly every way, but still use fuels just as toxic as when we started.

	  // Tankage Branch	
      #LOC_SSS_tanks2_title = Early Tankage
      #LOC_SSS_tanks2_description = These fuel tanks are heavy, hard to build, and expensive, but they're the best we've got, so lets do what we can with them...
      #LOC_SSS_tanks3_title = Improved Tankage
      #LOC_SSS_tanks3_description = We've tried to merge the multiple layers of earlier tanks into one integrated one. This has resulted in slightly lighter tanks, but don't expect too much more out of them. Come on, don't look at us like that. We're trying our best.
      #LOC_SSS_tanks4_title = Mature Tankage
      #LOC_SSS_tanks4_description = We've had an interesting idea for new tanks, where, in order to save mass, we use the fuel as the support structure, meaning that we have to keep them topped off at all times, or they'll all crush like tin cans. What could go wrong with that?
      #LOC_SSS_tanks5_title = High-Performance Tankage
      #LOC_SSS_tanks5_description = "How does a tank perform better", you ask?	Well, it's quite simple really. A tank performs better when it no longer spontaneously explodes because someone looked at it funny.
      #LOC_SSS_tanks6_title = Medium-Lift Tankage
      #LOC_SSS_tanks6_description = It was real akward that one day when the new head engineer came in and started attaching treads rather than pipes to our latest batch of tanks. Apparently he didn't bother to read the job description...
      #LOC_SSS_tanks7_title = Heavy-Lift Tankage
      #LOC_SSS_tanks7_description = Although the name implies otherwise, the tanks are actually quite light, making them perfect for building bigger and better rockets.
      #LOC_SSS_tanks8_title = Super Heavy-Lift Tankage
      #LOC_SSS_tanks8_description = The tanks are so big we needed to create an entire new factory to build just one of them... That may begin to be a problem should we keep launching more rockets with them.
      #LOC_SSS_tanks9_title = Modern Tankage
      #LOC_SSS_tanks9_description = Modern rockets require modern tanks! 	
      #LOC_SSS_tanks10_title = Near-Future Tankage
      #LOC_SSS_tanks10_description = I assure you, these are 100% high-quality rocket fuel tanks, not stolen grain silos.
	  
	  //Nuclear Thermal Rockets Branch
      #LOC_SSS_ntr9_title = Nuclear Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_ntr9_description = These are no longer prototypes, which means they'll only fail 50% of the time...
      #LOC_SSS_ntr10_title = Improved Nuclear Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_ntr10_description = These newer NTRs use some slightly more complex designs then our first models. Don't worry though, they're only marginally less safe then the old ones! 	
      #LOC_SSS_ntr11_title = Mature Nuclear Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_ntr11_description = While some more konservative nations are still a tad apprehensive, we've proven to most of the world that nuclear engines can be operated fairly safely without causing a fallout apocalypse. Let's hope it stays that way.
      #LOC_SSS_ntr12_title = Gas Core NTRs
      #LOC_SSS_ntr12_description = The worst thing that could possibly happen to a nuclear reactor is a meltdown, so how about we just skip that phase and go right to a gas instead!
      #LOC_SSS_ntr13_title = Fusion Rocketry
      #LOC_SSS_ntr13_description = Nuclear fusion, when let loose, is far more dangerous and destructive than nuclear fission. That naturally means its also a far better option to use in our experimental rocket designs!
      #LOC_SSS_ntr14_title = Improved Fusion Rocketry
      #LOC_SSS_ntr14_description = We hold ourselves to a higher standard with fusion rockets, unlike our previous NTRs, we guarantee these engines will only fail 49% of the time, and that's a promise!

	  //Orion Drive Branch
      #LOC_SSS_orion13_title = Nuclear Pulse Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_orion13_description = When Whener first suggested that we could use nuclear bombs as an actual propulsion method, we though he had finally cracked and sent him off to a nursing home. We were horrifyed the following morning when we discovered the KSC was left a smoking crater after he snuck back in and had an apparently "successful" test.
      #LOC_SSS_orion14_title = Advanced Nuclear Pulse Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_orion14_description = Bada bing. Bada BOOM!

	  //Nuclear Reactors Branch
      #LOC_SSS_reactors5_title = Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators

      #LOC_SSS_reactors6_title = Improved RTGs
      #LOC_SSS_reactors6_description = In the outer worlds of our solar system, we can't rely on solar panels to produce enough power for probes. These RTGs might not make much, but it's still more that what those solar panels would make anyday.
      #LOC_SSS_reactors7_title = Advanced RTGs
      #LOC_SSS_reactors7_description = These devices are NOT authorized for usage as an emergency rover heating system by interplanetary castaways. 
      #LOC_SSS_reactors8_title = Nuclear Testing
      #LOC_SSS_reactors8_description = Unlike our peers over at Kos Alamos, these experiments won't explode in a nuclear fireball. At least, not intentionally...
      #LOC_SSS_reactors9_title =  Nuclear Reactors
      #LOC_SSS_reactors9_description = Nuclear reactors are a great way to produce power in space - everythings already irradiated like crazy up here, so its not like the inevitable meltdown is going to change anything...

      #LOC_SSS_reactors10_description =  
      #LOC_SSS_reactors11_title = Mature Nuclear Reactors
      #LOC_SSS_reactors11_description = Our reactors are reliable enough now that we don't need the axe-man waiting in the wings to SCRAM it when things go wrong.
      #LOC_SSS_reactors12_title = High-Power Nuclear Reactors
      #LOC_SSS_reactors12_description = We didn't actually do anything new with these reactors. They're the same as last generation, but now we're just running them so close to the meltdown temperature that it's not even funny.
      #LOC_SSS_reactors13_title = Experimental Fusion Reactors
      #LOC_SSS_reactors13_description = Don't worry! These will be producing net positive energy within the next ten years. We promise.

      #LOC_SSS_reactors16_title = Fusion Drives
      #LOC_SSS_reactors16_description = These advanced propulsion systems have finally reached the level of awesomeness where we can start calling them drives instead of engines.

	  //Electromagnetic Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_ion6_title = Prototype Ion Thrusters
      #LOC_SSS_ion6_description = While a lot of us are still convinced these things are little more than dark magic, Wherner insists there's real science behind them. 
      #LOC_SSS_ion7_title = Electrostatic Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_ion7_description = We all thought "lightning rockets" sounded cooler, but the Offical Board of Naming Things had other ideas.
      #LOC_SSS_ion8_title = Improved Electrostatic Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_ion8_description = These bad boys are a lot more mass-efficent, and will probably be effective even in the slightly more distant reaches of the solar system. They'd work great for our next mission to Dres, if we ever bother to go there.
      #LOC_SSS_ion9_title =  Mature Electrostatic Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_ion9_description = Gridded thrusters and all sorts of other fancy-schmancy things help make these engines much more effective, and equally power-hungry as well. 	

	  //Plasma/Anti-matter Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_plasma10_title =  Prototype Plasma Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_plasma10_description = Before you say it, yes, we already know plasma is actually a state of matter... 	
      #LOC_SSS_plasma11_title = Plasma Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_plasma11_description = WARNING: DO NOT LICK - the plasma coming out of these engines might look like "space ice cream" but I can assure you it most certainly isn't.
      #LOC_SSS_plasma12_title = Improved Plasma Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_plasma12_description = Now capable of firing for more than a few seconds without catastrophically overheating!
      #LOC_SSS_plasma13_title = Mature Plasma Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_plasma13_description = One Kepstien Kerman was experimenting with theoretical plasma engines on his Dunatian space-yacht, when he accidentally turned one on which he couldn't shut off. He was never heard from again, but the plans he left behind have allowed us to build some pretty impressive new engines.
      #LOC_SSS_plasma14_title = Antimatter Experimentation
      #LOC_SSS_plasma14_description = Antimatter appears to react violently with any form of matter it touches, destroying it instantly. Because of this, our scientists think it's in our best interest to mess around with it as much as we can on the surface of Kerbin, where everything is made of matter, rather than in the vacumn of space.
      #LOC_SSS_plasma15_title = Antimatter Propulsion
      #LOC_SSS_plasma15_description = Antimatter is pretty scary to handle, and its reactions with matter produce all sorts of deadly radiation, not to mention normal explosions as well. However, the perks of antimatter-powered propulsion cannot be denied. It's pretty dang impressive! 	
      #LOC_SSS_plasma16_title = Unified Field Theory
      #LOC_SSS_plasma16_description = We've managed to unify all the various parts of science together in one gigantic blackboard-destroying equation. This will surely bode well in our search for the ultimate dream of kerbal-kind - a way to travel faster than the speed of light.
	  
	  //FTL Drives
      #LOC_SSS_ftl17_title = Faster than Light Travel
      #LOC_SSS_ftl17_description = Millenia of evolution, thousands of years of strife and conflict, hundreds of years of scientific research, and decades of space exploration have lead us to this moment. Now, here we stand, ready to unlock the key to the cosmos. We've finally done it. Together.
	  
	  // Electrics Branch
      #LOC_SSS_electrics1_title = Zinc-Carbon Batteries
      #LOC_SSS_electrics1_description = These batteries are expensive, heavy, and not very efficent, but they're the best we've got. 
      #LOC_SSS_electrics2_title = Space-Grade Electronics
      #LOC_SSS_electrics2_description = Turns out there's a lot of radiation in space. We've had to manufacture special circuts just to survive the harsh conditions
      #LOC_SSS_electrics3_title = Alkaline Batteries
      #LOC_SSS_electrics3_description =  These batteries can hold a lot more power, and are filled with tasty juices as well!
      #LOC_SSS_electrics4_title = Experimental Capacitors
      #LOC_SSS_electrics4_description = Capacitors hold in a lot of charge, and then spit it out really quickly on demand. We personally haven't found a use for them yet, but we're sure someone will one day.
      #LOC_SSS_electrics5_title = Fuel Cells
      #LOC_SSS_electrics5_description = The sun doesn't always shine, so we need a way to generate power when it doesn't.	
      #LOC_SSS_electrics6_title = Reliable Capacitors
      #LOC_SSS_electrics6_description = Capacitors are a lot more useful when we can trust them to not just spontaneously discharge whenever someone looks at them funny!
      #LOC_SSS_electrics7_title = Nickel-Hydrogen Batteries
      #LOC_SSS_electrics7_description = Apparently these things are calibrated to store RF rather than Electric Charge, whatever that's supposed to mean.
      #LOC_SSS_electrics8_title = Advanced Capacitors
      #LOC_SSS_electrics8_description = Make sure you plug these in the right way, or else all you'll have is a bunch of smoldering wires and molten metal!
      #LOC_SSS_electrics9_title =  Lithium-Ion Batteries
      #LOC_SSS_electrics9_description = These batteries have a bit of an "explosive" personality, but working with them is a blast!  	
      #LOC_SSS_electrics10_title = High-Density Capacitors
      #LOC_SSS_electrics10_description = At this point, the capacitors should finally have enough charge to actually run electric propulsion systems. You don't need to thank us, really, don't. 
      #LOC_SSS_electrics11_title = Super-Capacitors
      #LOC_SSS_electrics11_description = If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 km/s ... you're gonna see some serious science!

      #LOC_SSS_solar3_title = Primitive Solar Cells
      #LOC_SSS_solar3_description = The sun may be a deadly laser, but regardless, we've found a way to convert its light into power for our spacecraft.
      #LOC_SSS_solar4_title = Basic Solar Panels
      #LOC_SSS_solar4_description = Now that we can trust our solar panels to produce enough power to keep systems running, we can stop launching new satellites every day to replace the ones which ran out of charge.
      #LOC_SSS_solar5_title = Improved Solar Panels
      #LOC_SSS_solar5_description = Some of these solar panels are now retractable, which means we can now do stupidly close flybys of Minmus without having to worry about them smashing into the surface!
      #LOC_SSS_solar6_title = Advanced Solar Panels
      #LOC_SSS_solar6_description = Solar panels get more effective the closer to the sun you get. But don't get to closer, or you'll end up like Ikarus!
      #LOC_SSS_solar7_title = High-Quality Solar Panels
      #LOC_SSS_solar7_description = These solar panels are expertly handcrafted by highly trained technicans to ensure the most perfect power generating experience possible. That's why it takes us five years to produce one set of them.
      #LOC_SSS_solar8_title = Solar Arrays
      #LOC_SSS_solar8_description = Make sure to keep these things behind a fairing until you clear the atmosphere. You don't want them getting sheared off at max-Q!
      #LOC_SSS_solar9_title =  Modern Solar Panels
      #LOC_SSS_solar9_description = You fool! You expected yet another quip about modern rockets requiring modern things, but instead you got me, DIO!
      #LOC_SSS_solar10_title = Near Future Solar Panels
      #LOC_SSS_solar10_description = Although the name implies otherwise, not all of these panels were made by Nertea.
      #LOC_SSS_solar11_title = Microwave Power Transmission
      #LOC_SSS_solar11_description = Solar panels are heavy and bulky, so what if we just sent the power to the ships via a giant laser instead? 
      #LOC_SSS_solar12_title = Solar Sails
      #LOC_SSS_solar12_description = Just like Captain Robeau of antiquity, we too can sail across a very different sea.

      #LOC_SSS_thermal6_title = Radiators
      #LOC_SSS_thermal6_description = Heat gets really lazy out and space, and just plain old refuses to leave our spacecraft. These radiators will help boot it out before it cooks our crews to a crisp.
      #LOC_SSS_thermal7_title = Improved Radiators
      #LOC_SSS_thermal7_description = It appears that the best way to is make radiators better is to just make them even more intricately shaped and complex to build, even if we don't change any of the underlying technologu
      #LOC_SSS_thermal8_title = Heat Management Systems
      #LOC_SSS_thermal8_description = Originally we planned to design advanced systems to keep our experimental nuclear reactors cool, but we eventually decided on just having an intern stand around fanning them instead.
      #LOC_SSS_thermal9_title =  High-Temperature Radiators
      #LOC_SSS_thermal9_description = These radiators may seem like specialty space-grade devices, but in reality, they were just stolen off of one of the engineers' crypto-mining rigs.	
      #LOC_SSS_thermal10_title = Cryogenic Radiators
      #LOC_SSS_thermal10_description = These fancy liquid cooled radiators really help to cool off our spacecraft, and also help Jeb's gaming PC run better!.
      #LOC_SSS_thermal11_title = Entropic Thermal Radiators
      #LOC_SSS_thermal11_description = Who cares if we are releasing our waste heat into an infinite number of alternate realities. It's not our problem anymore!

      #LOC_SSS_construction2_title = Space-Grade Alloys
      #LOC_SSS_construction2_description = Rockets go through a lot of pretty insane forces during flight, so we're gonna need more than cardboard, duct tape, and zip-ties to make them orbit-capable. 
      #LOC_SSS_construction3_title = Interchangable Parts
      #LOC_SSS_construction3_description = One uppity intern pointed out that it might be easier to fix mistakes if we made it so we could easily swap out broken parts. We proceeded to replace him with a new intern.
      #LOC_SSS_construction4_title = Precision Machining	
      #LOC_SSS_construction4_description = Our machinists were pretty mad when they found out we were now expecting tolerances of +/- 1 inch.
      #LOC_SSS_construction5_title = Tooled Production Lines
      #LOC_SSS_construction5_description = While we love the special feeling of having Dinklestien Kerman handcraft every single part, it's not exactly the fastest way to make stuff. We're gonna give this a try instead.  	
      #LOC_SSS_construction6_title = Design Review Bureaus
      #LOC_SSS_construction6_description = After we had one to many launch fail-, I mean, unplanned rapid disassemblies, the government told us we need to start having third-parties check over our plans to make sure they don't violate the laws of physics.
      #LOC_SSS_construction7_title = Engineering Corps
      #LOC_SSS_construction7_description = We put together a team of our best and brightest engineers to solve our biggest problems. They said "engineer gaming" and now won't stop dancing around a briefcase in the VAB's basement.
      #LOC_SSS_construction8_title = Expanded Assembly Bays
      #LOC_SSS_construction8_description = We're gonna need a bigger building! These rockets are getting so huge they don't fit in the VAB anymore!

      #LOC_SSS_construction11_title = Orbital Shipyards
      #LOC_SSS_construction11_description = By constructing things in orbit, we don't have to worry about silly things like "aerodynamics" or "the rocket equation". This will let us build bigger and better spaceships!

      #LOC_SSS_railguns13_title = Railguns
      #LOC_SSS_railguns13_description = The backbone of any interplanetary artillery system, railguns use the power of electromagnetism to launch projectiles at incredible speeds. They'll be pretty useful in a system-wide war that will surely never happen due to us somehow exhausting all the resources of our planets...

      #LOC_SSS_logistics6_title = Life-Support Systems

      #LOC_SSS_logistics7_title = Service Modules
      #LOC_SSS_logistics7_description = As our rockets grew bigger and bigger, we started to realize that it wasn't sustainable to just strap everything we need on the side of the rocket. Instead, we've started cramming everything into specialized modules instead. //Jeb got tired of getting stuck running supplies back and forth, so we've got some robots to do it instead!

      #LOC_SSS_spaceStations7_title = Space Habitation
      #LOC_SSS_spaceStations7_description = The good news is that it looks like kerbals can handle living in space for extended periods of time. The bad news is that we don't know how long those extended periods can be. Time for some more science!

      #LOC_SSS_spaceStations9_description = If we ever want to make it to Duna and beyond, we need our crews to be able to survice in deep space for years on end. Where's a better place to practice that then on a space station only days away from home!  	
      #LOC_SSS_spaceStations10_title = Large-Scale Station Construction

      #LOC_SSS_bases11_title = Settlement Programs
      #LOC_SSS_bases11_description = By encouraging skilled civillians to join up and move to the colonies, we can expanded them far faster than if we were only using in-house astronauts. Let's just hope they don't get lost in space!

      #LOC_SSS_science5_title = Peer-Review Boards
      #LOC_SSS_science5_description = After we landed a probe on the Mun and proved, to the detriment of the entire scientific community, it wasn't made of cheese, we decided to start having scientists actually get their work checked over before we established it as a universal law, to avoid such embarrassments in the future.

      #LOC_SSS_science6_description = We've managed to finally figure out how to store our scientific data in electric storage systems, rather than on film reels. Keven Kielberg isn't happy, but most of our scientists agree that this will make science collection much easier.
      #LOC_SSS_science7_title = The Internet
      #LOC_SSS_science7_description = Our scientists will surely put the internet to good use in advancing scientific communications across the globe, rather than just watching cat videos during their shifts instead of researching.
      #LOC_SSS_science8_title = Data Science
      #LOC_SSS_science8_description = With the power of Exkel spreadsheets, no problem is unsolveable!
      #LOC_SSS_science9_title = String Theory
      #LOC_SSS_science9_description = While the offical theory states that everything in reality is made up of a bunch of little strings, a sizeable group of scientists argue for an alternate meaning, namely, that the strings represent that kerbals are actually all being manipulated by some higher power, almost like they were characters in a video game...	
      #LOC_SSS_science10_title = Quantumn Computing
      #LOC_SSS_science10_description = We actually have no idea how all these fancy computers operate. We all just keep making up giberrish ideas, and they all keep working!
