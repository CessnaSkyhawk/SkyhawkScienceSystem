	RESULTS
	{
	default = You take a picture of whatever the camera is pointing at. Pretty.
	default = While taking what can only be described as a masterpiece picture, you consider your odds as a career photographer.
	default = You wish that the picture you just took could just be printed out like a polaroid. Who knows, it could be the next big thing for space tourism.
	default = The shutter speed was accidentally set to a very long time, the resulting picture being a giant smear that reminds you of flavoured yoghurt.
	default = What do you mean the settings are all wrong? Aperture shmaperture, this is science!
	default = This would be a perfect addition to the KSC photo album!

	SunInSpaceHigh = She is very bright and very beautiful. Kerbol, the star that keeps Kerbalkind alive...
	SunInSpaceLow = The light coming off Kerbol has made the image pure white! You're lucky you didn't damage the camera...

	KerbinSrfLandedAdministration = The administrators grumble about it and most of them aren't smiling but you manage to get a group photo of everyone except Stan whose head you cut off in the frame.
	KerbinSrfLandedAstronautComplex = The astronauts being who they are begin fighting to see who is going to be in the center of the group photo.  Unsurprisingly, Jeb won.
	KerbinSrfLandedCrawlerway = The crawlerway is a long slab of concrete but your photo might one day make it into an abstract art gallery.
	KerbinSrfLandedFlagPole = It's a damned flag pole.  And there's not flag flying today.  So you took a picture of a long metal stick.
	KerbinSrfLandedLaunchPad = The details around the launch pad will be very popular with people playing the latest computer game - Human Space Program - a very popular game about a fictional race of creatures who go into space.
	KerbinSrfLandedMissionControl = The pictures from inside mission control were confiscated at the door by a vary large kerbal named Arnold.  You didn't argue.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&D = At first the researchers were extremely happy to have you photographing their experiments but when you started asking questions about what it revealed they got very angry and told you it was highly technical explosive blow uppie stuff and you wouldn't understand.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DCentralBuilding = You now have a picture of a large, unlabelled and unnamed concrete building.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DCornerLab = You now have another picture of another large concrete building and it happens to be on a corner.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DMainBuilding = Yet another large concrete building.  You would really like to have pictures from inside but the researchers won't let you in since you were asking too many questions they couldn't answer.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DObservatory = When you asked if you could attach your camera to the telescope to take some pictures they just looked at you funny.  You did get a good picture of the telescope itself though.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DSideLab = Look, another concrete building.  You can tell your grandkids one day some amazing story about something that didn't happen to you at this building.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DSmallLab = For just a moment, you thought you saw peering out of the window what appeared to be a tall, vaguely kerbal shaped figure with pinkish-brown skin, a roudn head and nearly 4 times the height of a normal kerbal.  It was disturbing and unfortunately the photo you took was blurred.  No one will believe you.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DTanks = It's a large tank filled with something that you are unable to identify and the researchers refuse to tell you what it is.
	KerbinSrfLandedR&DWindTunnel = The photos of the latest wind tunnel test of the new launch vehicle were confiscated by Arnold the Giant Kerbal again.  Newspapers are reporting a resounding success but you know better.  You just don't have evidence to prove it anymore.  The kerballed test is going forward.
	KerbinSrfLandedRunway = The photos of landing aircraft you took have turned out extremely well and appeared in Kane's Defense Weekly.
	KerbinSrfLandedSPH = Several pictures of the latest generation of space planes have made their way into the public and you're being blamed for it.
	KerbinSrfLandedSPHMainBuilding = You should go back to the runway for more pictures of aircraft.  The photos of large concrete buildings just aren't as interesting.
	KerbinSrfLandedSPHRoundTank = It's a tank full of jet fuel.  At least the pilots say that it is but secretly you believe this to be the storage vat for Jeb's supply of beer.
	KerbinSrfLandedSPHTanks = If Jeb's beer isn't in the round tank, it has to be here.  Unfortunately, if you're wrong when you open the tank it will likely mean your death.
	KerbinSrfLandedSPHWaterTower = On the hunt for Jeb's beer storage tank you have taken photos of the water tower.  Unfortunately Arnold the Giant Kerbal told you to come down halfway in your climb to the top to prove your theory.
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStation = As you start taking photos of the large comm dishes in the area, you see a black government car pull up but no one gets out.  They're just sitting there.  Watching you.
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishEast = The black government car pulls around the corner as you make your way to the east dish.  Maybe your camera is making them nervous.
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishNorth = Four kerbals wearing black suits and ties with dark sunglasses have all gotten out of the car.  One of them is talking to his wrist for some reason while looking directly at you taking your photographs.
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationDishSouth = As you hurry around the corner to the south dish you run head on into Arnold followed by one of the government suits.  There's a blinding flash of light and when you wake up no one is there, you can't remember anything and your camera is empty of all photos.
	KerbinSrfLandedTrackingStationHub = You were able to snap a shot of the hub but at the distance you took the picture it looks like nothing more than a mobile home with three large satellite dishes in the front yard.
	KerbinSrfLandedVAB = The VAB is so tall you had to lay on the ground to fit it in the frame.  You've won a $50 prize for an abstract photo contest with this image.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABMainBuilding = After winning your $50 photo contest with your other VAB shot you decided to try the same thing again.  Unfortunately this is old hat now and everyone is taking pictures by lying on the ground now.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABPodMemorial = The memorial is a somber reminder of all the brave souls who came before and gave their lives in service to the greater good.  That's what the researchers and engineers who blew them up say anyway.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABRoundTank = The hunt for Jeb's beer storage continues...
	KerbinSrfLandedVABSouthComplex = The engineers chose this location for their group photo.  It was lovely and all 219 asked you to make a copy of it for them.
	KerbinSrfLandedVABTanks = The ground crew chose this location for their ground photo.  You are nearly positive they were using this as a pretense to protect Jeb's beer storage.
	KerbinSrfLandedKSC = It really was much easier to fit the entire KSC in an image from the air.  Climbing to the top of the VAB just didn't cut it but you still got a resonably good shot of the grounds.

	KerbinSrfLanded = Haven't you seen this before?
	KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = Large rolling fields of long grass with very few trees create a pastoral image you couldn't pass up.
	KerbinSrfLandedTundra = The frozen tundra presents a stark view that is both nearly lifeless on a large scale but serenely beautiful.
	KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The mountain vistas or Kerbin are beautiful to behold and make for some of the best photos you have ever taken.
	KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = The striation of colors in layered landscapes of the badlands create vivid images at sunset.
	KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The rolling dunes, the vast plains of sand broken only by an occasional oasis and the lighting conditions make you feel like Kansel Kadams.
	KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Although the kerbals from this area speak with a brogue accent you can barely understand they have nevertheless guided you to locations within the highlands that allow you to bring out their subtle beauty in your photos.
	KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Glaciers, vast ice fields and chasms create a varied landscape which is captured wonderfully in your photos.  Your nose is also frost bitten now.
	KerbinSrfLandedShores = The photos of the shores you have taken have recently been licensed by a travel company to create brochures to bring tourists to the beach.
	KerbinSrfLandedWater = While the ocean is beautiful and terrible to behold at times, today it is nearly smooth as glass and you capture reflected sunlight from the surface of the water at sunset creating a lovely image.
	KerbinSrfLanded = Haven't you seen this before?
			KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The grasslands make up most of Kerbin’s surface, and where most Kerbals live. The surface is covered by farms and the occasional city.
			KerbinInSpaceLowShores = The water near shores have a lighter shade of blue where it gets shallower. If you could zoom in more you might be able to spot some kerbal a enjoying a day on the beach.
			KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = Snow-capped peaks used to be one of the best destination for adventurous kerbals. At least before the invention of space travel.
			KerbinInSpaceLowHighlands = The mountains blend into lower terrain with branching ridges. The hills are striped as the valleys cut through different layers of rock.
			KerbinInSpaceLowDesert = The sands look flat compared to the rest of Kerbin’s terrain. There are some strange circles on the surface, which command tells you are farms.
			KerbinInSpaceLowWater = The ocean’s surface is dotted with the wakes of ships traveling across Kerbin’s surface
			KerbinInSPaceLowBadlands = The surface looks rocky and difficult to navigate. You confirm the badlands are in fact bad.
			KerbinInSpaceLowTundra = You spot some Krussian military bases in the snow. The government agency who gave you your assignment will be pleased.
			KerbinInSpaceLowIceCaps = Sunlight reflecting off the snow overwhelms the camera.
			KerbinInSpaceLowNorthernIceShelf = Public Outreach tells the public you spotted the Gift Kracken, but you didn’t really.
			KerbinInSpaceLowSouthernIceShelf = There isn’t much here but a flat sheet of ice.
			KerbinInSpaceLow = Who knew the space agency would be spying on all these Krussians?
					KerbinInSpaceHigh = There is something very familiar about all this water and land you see.

	MunSrfLandedCanyons = Image data of the canyons on the Mun shows it was geologically active at one point in time but no longer.
	MunSrfLandedEastCrater = Photos of the East Crater are helping to answer some of the fundamental questions regarding the Mun's surface and how it has been affected by large imapacts.
	MunSrfLandedEastFarsideCrater = Imaging data from this "smaller" impact has proven just as important as that from the large craters around the Mun.
	MunSrfLandedFarsideCrater = A favorite landing site of many, photographic evidence helps to reveal this crater to be one of the oldest on the surface.
	MunSrfLandedHighland = The highland regions of the Mun appear to have been formed during a period where the surface of the Mun was still geologically active.
	MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = These small impact craters are younger and therefore photographic data helps to answer many questions about the different impact eras of the Mun.
	MunSrfLandedMidlands = As with other regions on the Mun, imaging data shows the midlands appear to have been thrust upward during a geologically active period on the Mun.
	MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = As with other smaller impact regions, the midland craters are shown through photo evidence to be younger than other impact areas around the Mun.
	MunSrfLandedNorthernBasin = This gigantic basin appears to be the result of molten rock flowing over the surface in the distant past.  Imaging data from the surface does not help to answer what may have caused it to flow in the first place.
	MunSrfLandedNorthwestCrater = This enormous impact region was formed during the earliest days of the Mun's formation which imaging data will help understand.
	MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = This high latitude impact region was formed around the same time as the Northwest Crater making it among the oldest areas of the Mun.  Photographic data from this region helps to reveal details of this impact and its aftermath.
	MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The polar lowlands appear to be a region formed during a geologically active period and was affected by the mammoth impact events occuring during that time.  Photographic evidence of this region helps to reveal how these processes interacted.
	MunSrfLandedPoles = Image data from the poles is helping to answer questions about the formation of the Mun and whether resources that could assist in creating a surface base exists.
	MunSrfLandedSouthwestCrater = The Southwest Crater was also formed around the same time as the other colossal sized craters on the surface.  Photographic evidence is helping to answer many of the questions surrounding this violent time of the Mun's history.
	MunSrfLandedTwinCraters = Formed when two bodies in orbit around each other collided with the Mun, photos of the Twin Craters have shown this region to be younger than originally thought
	MunSrfLanded = The ground is very grey. Around you, there are slopes and mountains.
			MunInSpaceLowMidlands = The surface is littered with small impact craters. The flat areas here may have been formed by volcanic activity.
			MunInSpaceLowMidlandCraters = You wonder how big of an asteroid is needed to make craters this wide, before realizing there are far larger craters on the Mun.
			MunInSpaceLowHighlands = The highlands are lighter in appearence,
			MunInSpaceLowHighlandCraters = Some of these craters look to be far older than the ones in the Mun’s midlands
			MunInSpaceLowCanyons = The steep walls of the canyons might make landing difficult.
			MunInSpaceLowNorthernBasin = The basin was likely formed by volcanic activity.
			MunInSpaceLowEastCrater = One of the most prominent landmarks on the Mun when viewed from the surface of Kerbin, Kerbals have spent millennia guessing what might have created it.
			MunInSpaceLowNorthwestCrater = Just another impact crater, located in the northwest.
			MunInSpaceLowSouthwestCrater = Just another impact crater, located in the southwest.
			MunInSpaceLowFarsideCrater = You reflect on how you’re the first kerbal to see this part of the Mun.
			MunInSpaceLowTwinCraters = Despite their similarity, these craters may have been created millions of years apart
			MunInSpaceLowEastFarsideCrater = The crater is nicely framed by Kerbin rising over the horizon.
			MunInSpaceLowPolarCrater = Unlike the rest of the Mun’s craters, this one is far from the equator.
			MunInSpaceLowPoles = Not much different from the rest of the mun, except that some parts of the polar region receive sunlight almost year round
			MunInSpaceLowPolarLowlands = Lower areas near the poles might contain water ice where craters are kept in eternal darkness. Or not. Its not like you can see anything in them.
			MunInSpaceLow = Closer to the moon now, you see that craters have ravaged the surface. Even the plains are unforgiven, which makes you infer that time has taken its toll on the Mun's surface...
				MunInSpaceHigh = The Mun appears to be very cratered while the lowlands sit pristinely below all of the mountains.

	MinmusSrfLandedLowlands = In pictures, the gently rolling lowlands almost appear to be the surface of roiling sea of melted mint ice cream.
	MinmusSrfLandedHighlands = The highland regions of Minmus are difficult to separate from other regions in photos requiring altitude measurements to know when the transition occured.
	MinmusSrfLandedSlopes = The highly irregular slopes of Minmus have often been observed in photos as appearing to be "scoops of ice cream" on the surface.
	MinmusSrfLandedFlats = It's flat, punctuated by a sharp increase in altitude around the perimeter.  Images help to show just how nearly perfectly level this region really is.
	MinmusSrfLandedGreatFlats = One of the largest flatland regions on the surface, in pictures the great flats appear to be a perfectly smooth frozen lake of green liquid.
	MinmusSrfLandedGreaterFlats = The largest continuous flat region on the surface, the Greater Flats may once have been a sea of liquid on the surface that has long since frozen.  Images from this region reveal just how large it is as certain areas actually go to the horizon with no change in appearance.
	MinmusSrfLandedLesserFlats = These smaller flat regions appear regularly around the moon and likely were small lakes at some point.  Photos taken in this region are surrounded on all sides by large hills forming the slopes and higher regions of Minmus.
	MinmusSrfLandedPoles = Image data from the poles is helping to answer questions whether Minmus was once a comet that was captured by Kerbin or whether some alien race simply spilled their giant bowl of mint ice cream.  Researchers are inclined to believe the former but the general public is another question...
	MinmusSrfLanded = The minty colored surface amazes you as you stare above and below where you have taken this photo.
		MinmusInSpaceLow = Minmus reveals varying terrain. High plateaus stretch for kilometres and the plains below them stretch even farther.
				MinmusInSpaceHigh = From so far away, Minmus resembles a small scoop of mint ice cream...

	MohoSrfLandedHighlands = Surface photos in the highlands reveal Moho had to have been volcanically active at some point in the past.  Lava fields and other geologic formations of this region could only have been formed by such activity.
	MohoSrfLandedMidlands = Photos taken within the midland region lend further support to the idea that much of Moho's surface has been shaped by volcanism.
	MohoSrfLandedMinorCraters = These various small craters are numerous on the surface of Moho and photos within them are helping to answer some of the questions about it's geologically active periods.
	MohoSrfLandedNorthPole = Unlike it's polar opposite, the north pole of Moho is extremely irregular and cratered with vastly different high and low points.  Photographic evidence clearly shows the highly varied surface.
	MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkhole = At one time, stories were rampant that an enormous hole existed in this region which penetrated deep into the planet.  Photographic evidence has shown this not to be true.  The public outcry of a government cover-up has reached epic proportions.
	MohoSrfLandedNorthernSinkholeRidge = A long, narrow ridge spanning a good deal of this sinkhole region shows up starkly in photographs.  It is believed to be the product of volcanism but more study will be needed.
	MohoSrfLandedCentralLowlands = The lowland regions of the planet are home to numerous small craters and dune like rock formations shown repeatedly in pictures of these regions.
	MohoSrfLandedWesternLowlands = Similar to the other lowland regions of the planet, evidence of volcanism and repeated impacts show up regularly in image data.
	MohoSrfLandedSouthWesternLowlands = The lowland regions in the west, just like the other lowland areas of the planet are home to clear geologic formations created by volcanism and photo evidence will help to fill in gaps in our knowledge of this world.
	MohoSrfLandedSouthEasternLowlands = Further study of the various lowland regions in image data will all help to identify the causes of Moho's volcanic past and will help in the study of tidal erosion caused by the sun.
	MohoSrfLandedCanyon = The deep canyons and sharp walls are further evidence of geologic activity on the planet as no liquid could have eroded this region.  Photo evidence helps to support the idea this region was created through volcanic activity.
	MohoSrfLandedSouthPole = The south pole of Moho is similar in appearance and formation as the various lowlands.  Nearly uniform in altitude with very few craters or differences in high and low points, image data reveals this to be as different from the north pole in appearance as it is in location.
	MohoSrfLanded = After your descent, you see the distinct features of the planet. Craters are visible as far as the eye can see.

	EveSrfLanded = The purple sand of this dense planet stretches across the surface. You get hungry and wonder if this sand is toxic if eaten...
	EveSrfLandedPoles = Image data from the surface shows just how uniform and regular the poles of Eve really are.  Slight variations in altitude are revealed but very little in the way of extensive surface features exist to break up the nearly flat regions.
	EveSrfLandedExplodiumSea = A vast, low lying sea of liquid hydrocarbons shows vividly purple in image data.  It is quite obvious that the coloration caused by the hydrocarbons in both the sea and atmosphere lends Eve its distinct appearance.
	EveSrfLandedLowlands = Very low altitudes and gentle, rolling landscapes make up most of the lowlands creating a very purple picturesque image.
	EveSrfLandedMidlands = Similar to the lowlands, the midlands differ primarily in their altitude.  The same rolling landscape with very little in the way of features is captured clearly in image data.

Unfortunately, this region faces away from Duna at all times leaving it largely in darkness due to the low levels of sunlight.
	IkeSrfLandedCentralMountainRange = The Central Mountain Range, on average, is even lower in altitude than the western ridge but it faces Duna at all times.  This creates opporunities for stunning views across the surface of Ike and out into space towards Duna which you take advantage of with your camera.
	IkeSrfLandedSouthEasternMountainRange = Like the Western Mountain Ridge, the Easter Range is located on the side of Ike facing away from Duna leaving it in shadowy darkness most of the time.  Your images do littel to illuminate this area.
	IkeSrfLandedSouthPole = The South Pole of Ike is a colossal plateau towering over 9000m in most places.  It also has a fairly level average surface slope making it an excellent place for landing and research.  However, due to Ike's axial tilt, it faces away from Duna and mostly lies in shadow except in the most westerly areas of the region making your image data difficult to interpret.
		IkeInSpaceLow = Ike shows its weathered terrain quite clearly. Mountain ranges dominate the surface while the plains come in dark, large patches.

	BopSrfLandedPoles = From here, Bop looks to be a massive carbon deposit.
	BopSrfLandedSlopes = Somebody has spilled coffee over the photo. Rendering it illegible.
	BopSrfLandedMara = A long time ago, this planet was visited by a massive asteroid
