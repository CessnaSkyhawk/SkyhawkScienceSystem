			KerbinInSpaceLowMountains = The clear skies make you think of your last kamping trip to the mountains.
			KerbinInSpaceLowGrasslands = The spring thunderstorms can get quite sizeable. We should warn people in the path of them.

			KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = That's a big thunderstorm. We might want to warn people nearby to watch out for flash floods.
			KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = Winter cloud cover blankets the region below, preventing you from seeing anything else of value.
			KerbinInSpaceLowBadlands = The clear skies don't tell you much, but the terrain below sure looks rugged.
			KerbinInSpaceLowShores = What a perfect day to go to the beach!
			KerbinInSpaceLowShores = The clear skies down't tell you much, but that storm you saw out to sea on the last orbit should be making for some nice surf.
			KerbinInSpaceLowShores = It's overcast and rainy on the coast. Suddenly, you're glad you have to work Tommatt's shift in the weather center today.
			KerbinInSpaceLowWater = So that's what a hurricane looks like from space.
			KerbinInSpaceLowWater = Uh-oh. That hurricane is headed for shore. We'd best warn everyone to get out of the way!

	PhobosInSpaceHighMinorCraters = Numerous small craters pock mark the surface of Phobos.
	PhobosInSpaceHighStickneyCrater = This single enormous crater covers much of one side of Phobos; the impact must have been nearly enough to destroy the entire moon.
	PhobosInSpaceHighGrooves = Several fascinating series of grooves are visible on much of Phobos' surface; these could be the result of impacts from material ejected from Mars.
	PhobosInSpaceHigh = This lopsided moon of Mars is apparently too small to become fully rounded under its own gravity, leaving it with a potato-like shape.
	JupiterInSpaceHigh = Bands of different colored clouds are visible in Jupiter's atmosphere; each band being driven in opposite directions by fierce winds.
	JupiterInSpaceHighGreatRedSpot = This reddish storm, formed at the intersection of two cloud bands, is continuously churning away with no signs of slowing down.
	JupiterInSpaceHighEquatorialBands = The stable cloud bands near the equator are continuously blowing in opposite directions, creating enormous vortices at the intersections.
	JupiterInSpaceHigh = The gas giant Jupiter is visible as a swirling globe of white and brown clouds.
	IoInSpaceHigh = Io's terrain is a mix of bright yellow, red, green and brown colored soil; interesting from above, but probably toxic on the surface.
	IoInSpaceHighPyroclasticWastes = Colorful yellow, red, and sometimes green materials coat areas of Io's surface, sometimes centered around active volcanoes.
	IoInSpaceHighVolcanicSnows = Bright white and grey areas are visible on much of Io's surface, probably composed of reflective sulfur dioxide frost.

	CallistoInSpaceHighValhallaCrater = This enormous impact crater contains several concentric ring formations, most likely formed soon after the impact event.
	CallistoInSpaceHighYoungCraters = The bright material surrounding some of these craters suggests that they were formed relatively recently.
	CallistoInSpaceHigh = Callisto looks like nothing if not a giant asteroid target.
	SaturnInSpaceHigh = Saturn's swirling brown clouds are in constant flux, likely propelled by ferocious, never-ending storms.
